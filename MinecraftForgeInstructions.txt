How to Use Minecraft Forge
If you go to the Referenced Libraries Folder, and click on forgeSrc you can see brown packages with all the class files for Minecraft.
In the src/main/java folder, make a new package with the name of your mod.
Add the java files from Github to the package through your file explorer.
